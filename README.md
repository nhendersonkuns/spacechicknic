  Math - 3
  Statistics - 3
  Machine Learning - 1
  Domain Exptertise - 3(Measurement and Analysis, process engineering)
  Communicaiton and presentation skills - 4
  Data Visualization - 3
In this course, I hope to improve my computer programming skills.  In the program, I hope to increase each of these skills, but I'm confident my programming skills will increase the most.
